# JS-BubbleSort
Rhett Hopton, 2020
This was a project completed at Joliet Junior College demonstrating a Bubble Sort function applied in JavaScript for a table of books.

This was completed in November 2020 as part of the JJC Programming curriculum in a JavaScript course by Rhett Hopton. 
This is a self-contained file that launches in a single .HTML file, open this on your favorite web browser!

All JS code is contained in the <Head> tag, which when the <Body> loads, it calls the buildTable() function to start the sort and building of the table elements.
